How to Run Game:
- make play (within project directory)
- (run [make build] first if first time loading up the game)

How to Run Tests:
- make test

Note: The first set of test cases takes in user input: it opens a window and prompts you to press keys to be used as user input. You can turn off these tests that depend on user input by setting the test_borders boolean near the top of the Main.ml test file to false. That way, only the tests that don't use user input (about 51 of them) will run. All of the test cases that do take in user input count as one test case (for a total of 52) so we could keep all of them in the same window.

Note: If you have issues with the graphics module when running the program, try following these same steps using this virtual machine instead: https://cs3110.github.io/textbook/chapters/appendix/vm.html
